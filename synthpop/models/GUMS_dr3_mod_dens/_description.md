### Gaia Universe Model DR3
This Model contains the Populations as described in the 
Gaia DR3 Documentaion (Chapter 2.2.2).
Since not all needed informations are provided in the documentation 
We changed the folowing steps. 


1) For the bar, the density profile is corrected to 
``N = N0* cosh(rs)^-2.``

2) The spiral arm structure is not implemented 

3) The local densities for the different Populations are taken from  
Mor et al. 2018.

Further, we currently use the Kinematic described in the Robin et al. 2003.
This will be updated in the Future.
